## Description

Procedural Terra is an educational project focused on exploring the capabilities of Perlin Noise. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to generate unique maps and islands by utilizing different seeds. The project aims to provide a platform for enthusiasts and learners to practice and experiment with Perlin noise techniques. Users can adjust essential parameters such as lacunarity, persistence, and the number of octaves in real-time to observe their influence on the generated Perlin noise map.
